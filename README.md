# percolation
University of Illinois, Illinois Geometry Lab Percolation research group
This percolation simulation takes a Monte-Carlo approach. 

Data structures:
Cell: a grid that has two edges connecting to its neighbors.
A two dimensional array of Cells.
A disjoint set that is used to guarantee the uniqueness of an existing path in the percolation process.
